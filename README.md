My code contained a class Car, which contains some classes as described below::

brake(x) : decreases the speed by x .If the speed is less than x than it becomes 0.
accelerate(x) : increases the speed by x.
move() : update the position x, y and z.
detect_collision : detects that car have collided or not by checking their current position.
time_of_collision : return the time taken to collide by just using vectors ; It calculates the distance between the two cars and divides it by their relative speed.
Sone maths function are also used.
